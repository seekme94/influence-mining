In this method, instead of merging communities, nodes are moved between communities such that each node makes a local decision that maximizes its own contribution to the modularity score.

This is motivated by the fact that edges connecting different groups are more likely to be contained in multiple shortest paths simply because in many cases they are the only option to go from one group to another. 
  # This method yields good results but is very slow because of the computational complexity of edge betweenness calculations and because the betweenness scores have to be re-calculated after every edge removal. 
  # Another disadvantage is that it builds a full dendrogram and does not tell where to cut the dendrogram to obtain the final groups, so we use some other measure (e.g. modularity score of the partitions) to decide that

In each step, the graph is split into two parts in a way that the separation itself yields a significant increase in the modularity. The split is determined by evaluating the leading eigenvector of modularity matrix, and there is also a stopping condition which prevents tightly connected groups to be split further.

  # The algorithm stops when it is not possible to increase the modularity any more, so it gives you a grouping as well as a dendrogram. The method is fast and it is the method that is usually tried as a first approximation because it has no parameters to tune.

  # The model is then simulated for a given number of steps, and the spin states of the nodes in the end define the communities. 
  # The consequences are that 1) There will never be more than 'c' communities in the end, although you can set c to as high as 200; 2) There may be less than 'c' communities in the end as some of the spin states may become empty; 3) In disconnected networks, it is not guaranteed that nodes in disconencted parts of the networks have different spin states.

  # walktrap.community: the general idea is that if you perform random walks on the graph, then the walks are more likely to stay within the same community because there are only a few edges that lead outside a given community. 
  # Walktrap runs short random walks of 3-4-5 steps (depending on parameters) and uses the results of these random walks to merge separate communities in a bottom-up manner like fastgreedy.community. We can use the modularity score to select where to cut the dendrogram.

  # label.propagation.community: a simple approach in which every node is assigned one of 'k' labels. The method then proceeds iteratively and re-assigns labels to nodes in a way that each node takes the most frequent label of its neighbors in a synchronous manner. The method stops when the label of each node is one of the most frequent labels in its neighborhood. 
  # It is very fast but yields different results based on the initial configuration (which is decided randomly), therefore it should be run a large number of times before labeling.
